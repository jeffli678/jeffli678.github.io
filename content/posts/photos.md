I used to be a keen photographer. I treat photography as a way of expressing my views toward the world. My photos capture both the beauty and absurdity of this world. 

However, I have not taken very few photos in recent years. One excuse is I become busy and get obsessed with reverse engineering. But a more convincing reason is I am less interested in this world. The situation might change in the future, though.
