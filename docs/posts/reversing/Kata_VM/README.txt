Challenge: KataVM Level 1
Author: Towel <towel@protonmail.com>, @0xTowel
Year: 2021

Info:
    A small challenge with a virtualized function. It is not designed to be overly difficult.
    Instead, it is designed to give you something simple to practice on.
    No fancy dynamic obfuscations or static analysis protections -- just the VM.
    There is no flag, just working input and non-working input.

Goal:
    Your task is to find input that gives you the success message.
